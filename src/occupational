                                <p style="color:#000;">Occupational Therapy is the use of assessment and intervention to develop, recover or maintain meaningful activities of individuals, groups or communities. It is an allied health profession performed by occupational therapists who often work closely with other professionals like Physiotherapy, Speech Therapy, Audiology, social work, medicine and assistive technology.</p>
                                <p style="color:#000;">Sensory integration in Occupational Therapy makes the child feel sensory experiences that include touch, movement, body awareness, sight, sound, smell and taste. The pull of gravity is a sensory experience which takes place in a sensory rich environment called “Occupational Therapy Gym”.</p>
                                <p style="color:#000;">The ultimate goal of OT is to bring the child from an over sensitive/under reactive state through sensory stimulation. OT deals with gross and fine motor skills, visual-perception, muscle strength, cognitive skills, activities to cope with daily living and sensory-processing deficits through a sensory integration approach. Activity level whether high/low, coordination problem, poor organisation, poor self-concept , delay in speech, language, motor skills or academic achievements are worked upon in an active, meaningful and fun way so that the child behaves in a more functional manner in all the everyday activities.</p>
                                <p style="color:#000;">OT intervention for ASD and SLD is an ongoing process (the child will always need sensory inputs throughout their life), hence parents are also involved.</p>
                                <p style="color:#000;">They work with the therapists to learn more about their child’s sensory challenges and how to overcome them through various techniques and therapeutic devices. This is called a ‘sensory diet’. The child’s therapist will provide ideas to teachers and others outside the family who interact regularly with the child. Families have the opportunity to communicate their priorities for treatment purpose.</p>
