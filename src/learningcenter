                                    The Learning Centre for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), is an exclusive school catering to the needs of children at all levels of ASD. The school balances academics with skill training and guides the student to be self-reliant. <br>Diverse learning approaches are implemented to help students cope with their condition.
