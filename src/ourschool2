                                    The teaching methodology for Learning Disability is focused with a holistic approach to instruction. Academic skills are taught in conjunction with life skills using Multi-sensory Teaching Methods*.

                                <p style="color:#000;">There is a growing body of evidence supporting Multisensory teaching, much of it supported by the National Institute of child Health and Human Development (NICHD), USA. Multisensory teaching is about simultaneously using visual, auditory, and kinesthetic-tactile (VAKT) methods to enhance memory and learning. Links are consistently made between the visual (what we see), auditory (what we hear), and kinesthetic-tactile (what we feel) pathways in learning to read and comprehend.</p>

                                <p style="color:#000;">The Open School provides after school remedial help to children from mainstream schools.</p>
                                <p style="color:#000;">Remedial teaching consists of tailor - made intervention programmes designed to meet the specific needs of a child. The teachers focus on the learning outcomes of the child by teaching one student at a time to overcome Learning Difficulties in reading, comprehension, writing and spelling.</p>
                                <p style="color:#000;">The remedial teachers understand the strengths and weakness of a child and adopt appropriate teaching strategies to improve their overall academic performance.</p>
