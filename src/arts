                                <p style="color:#000;">Arts based Therapy is defined as the clinical and evidence based use of art forms such as music, drama and visual arts, to accomplish individual goals within a therapeutic relationship. It helps in the psychosocial rehabilitation and neuro-physiological rehabilitation of children and adults with Special Needs through the use of multiple art forms. ABT uses elements of rhythm, stories, games and visual art to address specific needs. It is an evolving process that provides scope for improvisation and self expression. Arts based techniques have also been useful to improve gross and fine motor coordination, learning outcomes and to facilitate learning by developing the narrative capability and levels of attention of the students.</P>
                                <p style="color:#000;">It is different from co-curricular activities as it is non-judgmental and it does not assess the child on the level of mastery achieved in a particular activity.</P>
                                <p style="color:#000;">We are one of the few schools offering this allied therapy.</P>
